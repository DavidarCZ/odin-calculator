# Odin Project - Project: Calculator

This project is part of the Odin Project's curriculum.

It is the last project of Foundations course so it is meant showcase all I have learned: HTML, CSS, Flexbox, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, Git, my prowess and patience. :)

It is simple calculator app where you put two numbers and get result. It has clear(C) function which resets everything.

Some functionality choices were made because of assignment. Such as
operations not taking the default zero unless equals is pressed or restarting calculator after getting result instead of taking the result as first number.
